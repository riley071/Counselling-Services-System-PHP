# Counselling Services System PHP
 The primary purpose of this project is establishing a counseling services system for Vintage Wellness Centre to eliminate the challenges that the organization was having at the expense of its current system. A wide range of manual activities or operations performed by workers is on the verge of being automated, to simplify the tasks at hand for each initial user while increasing efficiency through the use of online technology.
